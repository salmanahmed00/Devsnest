You are given two integers, a and b.
Compute the Sum and Difference of a and b. Return the Product of Sum and Difference.

Input Format
First Parameter - Integer a

Second Parameter - Integer b

Output Format
Return the integer.

Example 1:
Input:
    5
    2
Output:
    21
Explanation:
    Sum is (5 + 2)  = 7 and Difference is (5 - 2) = 3. The product of Sum and Difference is 21.
Example 2:
Input:
    -14
    -4
Output:
    180
Explanation:
    The Sum is -18 and Difference is -10. The product is 180.
Constraints
-10^4 <= a, b <= 10^4
Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
